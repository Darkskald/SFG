[urgent fixes]

- copy class description to github readme
- copy ipy_interpreter instructions to github readme (and translate them to English..)
- add todo data to this file
- implement UV/Vis and IR/Raman support to IPy interpreter:
- transfer the file fetcher/datacollector idea to the uv/vis system
- test the result of the integration routine with the numerical functions from scipy for accuracy:
	-if scipy better, replace
- recycle the plot boknis special function from the old Interpreter
- expand the Spec_utilities SpecDatabase functionality drastically:
        - keeping, refining etc to separate it from the interpreter code
        - direct and simple access via the interpreter
        - refine the addition operator for two SpecDatabase objects to join their spectra and
          give access to IR and Raman plotting in one plot
        - reunite the show_ir, show_raman...etc from interpreter to a single show function taking
          a flag instead of having three parallel functions
- set a time frame whitch features have to be implemented before the next group seminar
- todo: add docstring to EVERY function/class method


[important features]

- add Kristians Data to the library:
- check names of files
- check names and format of DPPC reference
- semi-automatic analysis (in text form):
	- scan all data
	- count: amount of spectra of each surfactant
	- for each surfactant: write analysis file:
		- peak : count : integral



[nice-to-have-features]
- call results from elementary analysis from Interpreter
- add user interaction in peak picking and integration (shift peak borders, manually delete/add maxima)
- add integration and peak picking etc to UV, IR, Raman
- add a mechanism to call the toDo things from the file to the interpreter
